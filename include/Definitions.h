/**
    Base URL of the direct-play signaling service (see docs/direct-play.md).

    This service introduces players to each other and does nothing else: it never carries a
    gameplay byte, and a match keeps running if it goes away. It is deliberately a different path
    from the relay endpoint above, so that an admission answer cannot move a direct match back
    onto somebody's server - the client refuses a "/relay" address on this setting outright.
