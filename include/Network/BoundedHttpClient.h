/**
    One bounded HTTPS request at a time, and never a blocking one.

    Every request this game makes to the online service - the admission request that produces a
    grant, and the session, poll and signal requests that introduce players to each other - is a
    small POST whose answer has a known maximum size. They share one implementation so that they
    share one set of guarantees: no redirect is followed, no ambient credentials or proxy are
    used, the response is bounded before it is allocated and again while it streams, and a
    request that is cancelled or outlives its caller cannot write into freed state.

    Hardening one of those boundaries and not the other is how the weaker one becomes the way in;
    the admission request is the *first* thing a direct match does, so it gets the same treatment
    as the rest.

    The interface is abstract so tests can script a service without a socket, and so the two real
    backends (libcurl natively, Fetch in the browser) stay out of their callers.
