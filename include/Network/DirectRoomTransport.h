#ifndef DIRECTROOMTRANSPORT_H
#define DIRECTROOMTRANSPORT_H

/**
    A room whose gameplay never touches a server.

    HTTPS admission says who may be in the room. This transport then asks the signaling service
    for a session, learns who else is in the room, and opens one WebRTC data channel to each of
    them. From the moment the channels are open, the service carries nothing: it is polled for
    membership and phase, and it may go away entirely without ending the match.

    What it deliberately does not do:

      - no relay, no TURN and no forwarding. A message is sent once per peer over that peer's own
        channel, and a message addressed to someone else is dropped rather than passed on.
      - no fallback to HTTP or WebSocket gameplay. A peer that will not connect is a player-facing
        failure, because a silent fallback is how "direct play" quietly becomes relayed play.
      - no second game parser. A received payload goes to the same NetworkManager receive path,
        and from there to GamePayloadRouter, as every other transport.

    Identity: the signaling service tells each member which DTLS fingerprint it admitted for the
    others. A description whose fingerprint does not match is refused before it reaches the RTC
    stack, and the RTC stack then verifies the certificate actually presented against the
    fingerprint in the description it accepted. So the peer that ends up on the channel is the
    peer the HTTPS admission let into the room.
