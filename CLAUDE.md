# CLAUDE.md — DuneCity

You are working in `~/development/dunecity`, a Dune Legacy C++17/SDL2 fork with Micropolis-style city simulation integrated into the RTS game loop.

## First reads

Before making non-trivial changes, read:

1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — repo-root entry point and settled constraints
2. `docs/dunecity-current-architecture.md` — code-verified current implementation state
3. `README.md` — project overview/build commands
4. Relevant source files for the task

For deeper background only when needed:

- `analysis/delivery-summary.md` — historical integration summary; useful but may be stale versus current code
- `analysis/architecture-comparison.md`
- `analysis/dunelegacy-architecture.md`
- `analysis/simcity-architecture.md`
- `scripts/SPRITE-IMPORT.md` for sprite/art pipeline work

## Hard architecture constraints

- R/C/I zones stay **2x2 in gameplay footprint**.
- Do **not** convert simulation, placement, or zoning rules to 3x3.
- Micropolis/SimCity 3x3 art may be referenced/imported, but adapt/render it cleanly inside the 2x2 gameplay footprint.
- Tiles remain the current substrate for city state and overlays.
- Lot objects are a possible future architecture, not an opportunistic refactor.
- **Roads are player-built structures**, alongside but separate from concrete slabs. Like Slab1, a Road is special-cased in `House::placeStructure` to mutate a tile flag (`Tile::isRoad_`) rather than spawning a `StructureBase` — so roads aren't selectable. Roads only appear in the build menu when city-sim mode is active (gated in `BuilderBase::updateBuildList`). Cost defaults to 10 credits; build is instant in city mode.
- Concrete slabs (Slab1/Slab4) and Roads are **independent tile states**. Concrete renders as concrete; roads render as an auto-tiled overlay sprite drawn on top of the underlying rock terrain. They do not share rendering or placement logic.
- **Power flows globally** based on `producedPower >= powerRequirement` on the structure's owner. There is no per-tile electrical grid and no power lines. `Tile::cityPowered_` exists in save format but is unused; the legacy `cityConductive_` was renamed to `isRoad_`.
- Dune-style power remains; WindTraps and the city-mode Nuclear Plant feed the same global house-power pool.
- Preserve deterministic simulation and save/load compatibility.

## Workspace boundaries

- Edit files under `~/development/dunecity` only unless explicitly instructed.
- `../simcity` is read-only Micropolis reference.
- Do not hand-edit generated/imported assets unless the task is specifically about the asset pipeline.

## Likely touch points

City simulation:

- `include/dunecity/`
- `src/dunecity/`
- `include/Tile.h`, `src/Tile.cpp`
- `include/Game.h`, `src/Game.cpp`
- `include/Command.h`, `src/Command.cpp`

Zone/build/render work:

- `src/structures/ZoneStructure.cpp`
- `include/structures/ZoneStructure.h`
- `src/structures/ConstructionYard.cpp`
- `src/structures/BuilderBase.cpp`
- `src/FileClasses/GFXManager.cpp`
- `include/FileClasses/GFXManager.h`
- `scripts/import-micropolis.py`
- `scripts/import-sprites.py`
- `imported_sprites/`

Tests:

- `tests/`
- `tests/CMakeLists.txt`

## Versioning

The canonical app version lives in three source-controlled files, kept in sync by `scripts/bump-version.sh`:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh 1.0.8          # set version
scripts/bump-version.sh --check        # verify all files agree
scripts/bump-version.sh 1.0.8 --dry-run  # preview changes
```

Tag releases use `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v1.0.8`). CI verifies that source metadata already matches the tag before building; it will not auto-bump for you.

Do not hand-edit `CMakeLists.txt` project VERSION, `include/config.h` VERSION, or `vcpkg.json` version separately. Use the script.

Generated build outputs (`build/include/config.h`, app bundle `Info.plist`) are not source of truth -- they are derived at configure/build time from `CMakeLists.txt`.

Release/version rule: any user-visible release build, tag, or CI-triggering push must include the intended version bump in the same commit as the release work. Before saying a release is tagged, pushed, building in CI, or ready for Stefan to test, run:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh --check
git diff -- CMakeLists.txt include/config.h vcpkg.json
git tag --points-at HEAD
```

If the tag is meant to be `vX.Y.Z`, the checked version must be exactly `X.Y.Z`. If it is not, stop and fix the version before tagging or reporting completion.

## Build/test commands

Use targeted verification. Start with:

```bash
cmake --build build --target dunelegacy
cmake --build build --target dunelegacy_tests
./build/tests/dunelegacy_tests
```

For every Claude implementation run that changes gameplay, UI, assets, config,
or release/version behaviour, leave a locally built version in Stefan's dev
checkout before reporting completion:

```bash
cd /Users/stefanclaw/development/dunecity
cmake --build build --target dunelegacy
open build/bin/dunecity.app
```

The `open` command is optional and only for manual smoke testing; the required
deliverable is that `build/bin/dunecity.app` is rebuilt in the dev folder so
Stefan can launch it. If the local build tree is stale or the target names have
drifted, fix the build-tree issue or report the exact blocker instead of
claiming the feature is done.

For builds intended for Stefan or a release tag, verify the source-controlled
version first with `scripts/bump-version.sh --check`, then rebuild. Do not rely
on an already-open app bundle, a stale build tree, or a tag name as proof of the
visible version.

If those fail because the local build tree is stale or target names differ, inspect `README.md`, `BUILD.md`, `CMakeLists.txt`, and `tests/CMakeLists.txt` before changing build configuration.

## Style of work

- Prefer small, compileable changes.
- Fix the direct cause before broad refactors.
- Add/update tests when touching placement, rendering lookup, command routing, save/load, or city sim behaviour.
- Keep DuneCity-specific logic clearly named and isolated where possible.
- If a task tempts you to redesign zoning, stop and write the tradeoff down first.

The main trap: solving a 3x3 art/rendering problem by accidentally changing the 2x2 gameplay architecture. Don’t step on the rake. It has teeth.
