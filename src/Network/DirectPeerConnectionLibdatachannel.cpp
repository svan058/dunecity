/**
    The native half of a direct match: a real WebRTC data channel, from libdatachannel.

    It has to interoperate with a browser running P2PKit's RTCTransport, so everything visible on
    the wire is the browser's: a data-only SDP, candidates carrying their media id, the channel
    label "p2pkit", and the chunk packets defined in include/Network/P2PWireFraming.h.

    Thread safety is the delicate part. libdatachannel invokes callbacks on its own worker
    threads, and closing a peer connection does not guarantee that a callback already inside the
    library has returned. So no callback captures `this`: they capture a shared_ptr to a small
    state object that outlives the connection object if it has to, and every one of them takes
    that object's mutex and checks a closed flag before touching anything. The game thread only
    ever sees a snapshot taken in update().
