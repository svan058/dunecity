/**
 * The browser half of a direct match.
 *
 * The game is WebAssembly and cannot hold an RTCPeerConnection, so this module owns the
 * connections and exposes a queue-shaped, string-only surface that C++ can call synchronously
 * (src/Network/DirectPeerConnectionEmscripten.cpp). Nothing here interprets the game protocol:
 * what crosses this boundary is the envelope text defined in include/Network/P2PWireFraming.h,
 * and it is passed through opaquely in both directions.
 *
 * The transport itself is P2PKit's hardened RTCTransport, used directly - not its mesh, broadcast
 * or RPC layers, and never a TURN server. Fragmentation belongs to RTCTransport's Chunker, which
 * is why this module hands it a whole value and never a fragment: the native side fragments
 * exactly once too, with the same rules, so the two interoperate.
