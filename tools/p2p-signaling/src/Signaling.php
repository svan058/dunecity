/**
 * Introducing two admitted players to each other, and nothing else.
 *
 * There is no gameplay endpoint here and no byte of game traffic ever passes through this
 * service. It holds a room's membership, carries offers, answers and trickled candidates between
 * two members of that room, attests which DTLS certificate it admitted for each direction of each
 * pair, and reports the room phase. Once the data channels are open the players do not need it,
 * and a match survives it going away entirely.
 *
 * The authorisation rule is short: **membership is the authorisation**. `to=` must be a current
 * member of the same room, in the same epoch, as the caller. A peer can never address, enumerate
 * or reach anything outside its own room, and the service never moves bytes between two peers
 * that are not both members of one room.
 *
 * Fingerprints are bound per (room, from, to) - per RTCPeerConnection - and not per participant.
 * Each peer connection a browser or libdatachannel opens normally carries its own certificate, so
 * in a three-player mesh one participant legitimately presents two different fingerprints. What
 * must not change is the fingerprint on one *link*: once a pair's first description is seen, a
 * later description with a different fingerprint is refused, which is what stops somebody else
 * taking over an admitted player's seat.
